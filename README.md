## You can try out this application by installing flask with pip:
```bash
python -m pip install flask
```
## Run the following command inside the folder that contains app.py:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```
Optionally, you can set FLASK_ENV to development, which puts Flask in debug mode:
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
```
